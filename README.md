## Why should we study AUTOMATION SKILLS now??
As you guys may have noticed, this world is going to be transformed into something like a **dystopia** based society sooner or later...., so we are forced to be get accustomed to it.  
And I came to the conclusion that **AUTOMATION** is one of the most important skills in order to avoid poverty and keep getting income.  
Honestly I really want to go back to the Japanese 1980's era when I was really innocent and wanna go back to the time when I had simply been allowed to keep playing my stupid video games, but it seems like that the time has come to transform into something completely different human beings, haha.
## Learn step by step
I am gonna update code samples regularly, which consist of **Step 1**, **Step 2**, **Step 3**, and so on, so that everyone including me can understand the skills step by step.
## Philosophy
* For the time being, I am gonna focus on **AWS** as the IaaS cloud vendor, since AWS is the most exclusive cloud vendor for now.
* I am gonna use **Ubuntu Server** for a server's distribution, since I consider **Ubuntu** as the best distribution as far as from the perspective of simple learning use. Furthermore, I believe that Ubuntu can prevent from ending up **vendor lock-in** and to keep using Ubuntu can ensure a Multi-Cloud expandability in the nearest future use. (I have no intention of scripting any Amazon Linux or CentOS-flavored codes)
* These codes are made only for a **learning use**, so please do not use them for a production use. It is easily predicted that I'm not gonna reach to the professional level...
# What else do we need to survive?
## Use PC instead of excess use of smart phone
Please avoid **"To be used by smart phone" life** and change to **"Use PC and create something proactively" life**. The gap between **"To be used"** person and **"Create something to let someone to be used"** person is heartlessly going to grow wider and faster within the next few years.  
If we are still the same in our life, our income may keep going down because people other than you are making an effort to make their life more automated.  
It means that they consequently void your **sincere but old-school effort** and exploit your money indirectly - unconsciously. It's not a matter of preference, but a matter of how society acts...very cruel fact....
## Use GitHub as just your private diary (keep away from "To show someone" sns)
For me, it seems like this world connected too much with each other, and to become famous or influencer is getting harder and harder with such **complicated** and **competitive** world.  
That's why I recommend that use your sns just to **RECORD** your action or memory like an analog diary - with a hope that someday someone would know your **honesty**, **sincereness**, and **patience** which possibly lead to your future **success**.  
With this GitHub as my private diary, of course I am happy to switch all my repositories to **PUBLIC** to share ideas with everybody, but the main purpose is "To record the ideas" which **PLEASE!!** may save **Honest People** even after the world completely collapsed.  
So please do not hesitate to carve your name on the **ground** (get your feet back on the ground), god knows everything what you did with this life.
